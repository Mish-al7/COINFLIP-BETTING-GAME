1. Install the required dependencies:

"pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-login"

2. Set up a proper production server (like Gunicorn or uWSGI) instead of Flask's development server.
3. Use a production-grade database like PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.
4. Implement proper security measures:
  HTTPS with SSL certificates
  Strong password policies and hashing
  Rate limiting to prevent abuse
  CSRF protection


5. Integrate with a real payment processor for deposits and withdrawals.
